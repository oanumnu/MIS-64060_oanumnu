as it is shows multiple volumes of brand purchases and this may confuse the model. It is better to have a derived variable from "Purchase volume

Cluster 1 has 217cstomers and cluster 2 has 383customers
Cluster 1 has highEr values for all variables except Avg.Price and children
cluster 1 has higher brand loyalty, they have higher volumes and value. 
Cluster 1 has higher financial capacity and more people in the house which can explain the higher spending.
cluster 2 has more children, (maybe the brands represented in the data are not child friendly)
Advertising agencies can use this clustering to target customers effectively.
manufacturers can monitor their market share ( child product manufacturers will clearly favour cluster 2)

Cluster 1 has 124customers aand cluster2 has 476customers
Cluster 1 is higher in all variables
Cluster 1 does not seem to be affected by price discounts. 
Cluster 1 is buying more, has more available income, more people in the household and more
children

Cluster 1 are high value customers and should be targeted with high value products
Cluster 2 seem to be lower valus customers that respond to price changes, this charateristics can also be used as a marketing approach.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
